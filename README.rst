Liblarch, a python library to easily handle data structure
===============================================================================


Liblarch is a python library built to easily handle data structure such are
lists, trees and acyclic graphs [#]_.
There's also a liblarch-gtk binding that will allow you to use your data
structure into a ``Gtk.Treeview``.

Liblarch support multiple views of one data structure and complex filtering.
That way, you have a clear separation between your data themselves (*Model*)
and how they are displayed (*View*).

If you find ``Gtk.Treeview`` and ``Gtk.Treemodel`` hard to use, then
**liblarch** is probably for you.

The documentation can be read on: https://live.gnome.org/liblarch


Liblarch is released under the **LGPLv3** license.
